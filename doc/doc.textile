In the documentation directory, you'll find:

* @build.txt@: Building Hedwig, or how to set up Hedwig
* @user.txt@: User's Guide, or how to program against the Hedwig API and how to run it
* @dev.txt@: Developer's Guide, or Hedwig internals and hacking details

These documents are all written in the "Pandoc":http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ dialect of "Markdown":http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/. This makes them readable as plain text files, but also capable of generating HTML or LaTeX documentation.

Documents are wrapped at 80 chars and use 2-space indentation.
